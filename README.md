# Cybersecurity Projects

## Major Project: Advanced Cybersecurity Techniques

### 1. **WiFi Security: WPA/2 Handshake Capturing and Key Cracking**
   - **Objective**: To understand and demonstrate the security vulnerabilities in WiFi networks using WPA/2 encryption.
   - **Process**:
     - Utilized a network adapter in monitor mode to capture WPA/2 handshake packets.
     - Employed tools like `aircrack-ng` to perform a brute-force attack on the captured handshake and crack the WiFi password.
   - **Outcome**: Successfully cracked the WPA/2 encryption key, demonstrating the importance of strong passwords and updated security protocols.

### 2. **Session Hijacking using DVWA**
   - **Objective**: To explore web application vulnerabilities by performing session hijacking.
   - **Tools Used**: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), Burp Suite, and Wireshark.
   - **Process**:
     - Manipulated HTTP requests and sessions to hijack an active user session.
     - Gained unauthorized access to the user account by exploiting session management weaknesses.
   - **Outcome**: Successfully hijacked user sessions, underscoring the need for secure session handling in web applications.

### 3. **RSA Encryption and Steganography**
   - **Objective**: To implement RSA encryption and understand data hiding techniques using steganography.
   - **Process**:
     - Generated an RSA key pair (public and private keys).
     - Encrypted the text file `cipher.txt` containing my name using the RSA public key.
     - Used a steganography tool to hide the encrypted `cipher.txt` within an image file.
     - Demonstrated decryption of the hidden message using the RSA private key.
   - **Outcome**: Successfully encrypted and hid data, demonstrating the combination of cryptographic and steganographic techniques for enhanced data security.

## Minor Project: Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)

### **Web Application Penetration Testing on [testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com)**
   - **Objective**: To conduct a comprehensive security assessment of a vulnerable web application.
   - **Tools Used**: OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).
   - **Process**:
     - Scanned the target web application for common vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP.
     - Conducted both automated and manual testing techniques to identify security flaws such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and insecure authentication.
     - Documented each vulnerability with detailed descriptions, proof-of-concept exploits, and recommendations for remediation.
   - **Outcome**: Created a detailed Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report outlining all identified vulnerabilities and providing strategic recommendations for securing the application.
